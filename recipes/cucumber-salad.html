            <li> 2 large cucumbers,peeled and thinly sliced </li>
            <li>1 sweet onion, thinly sliced</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 table spoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

                 and pepper for dressing together in a bowl until 
                 smooth. Pour over cucumber mixture and stir until 
                 coated.</li>
